# Final-Year-Project-Online-News-Classification
The topic of false news has received a lot of attention recently as a result of its broad distribution on digital platforms. The term "fake news" describes news reports that are purposefully made up or deceptive, frequently in an effort to attract clicks or sway public opinion. 


The spread of fake news has detrimental effects, including misleading the public, undermining public confidence in journalism, and escalating social and political polarisation. Researchers have created a number of methods to automatically identify and categorise false news stories in response to this difficulty.


 Utilising technology is one promising strategy. Algorithms that can accurately classify news stories as legitimate or fraudulent by learning from vast volumes of data. Machine learning algorithms can be trained to find significant text patterns. 
We have used two methods: Logistic Regression and Decision Tree Classifier to classify the news as being fake or true.
The proposed approach has several potential applications, such as social media monitoring, news filtering, and content moderation. 


By automatically detecting and filtering out fake news, we can help reduce the spread of misinformation and improve the quality of information available to the public.
Area of Domain for our project is Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

We have applied two algorithms:Logistic Regression and Decision Tree Classifier.
